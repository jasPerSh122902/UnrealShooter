# Shooter

This project is a demonstration of raycasting and projectile bullets and how they work. This was made in **Unreal 4.27** and I used nothing but _c++_.


# How to Move

W = forward

S = back

A = left

D = right

LeftClick mouse = projectile bullet

E = raycast

# Demonstraction summary
The demonstration has a few odd behaviors. The projectile will only go left or right of the walls. The ray trace is very short. 

# potental problems
Sometimes when the player gets hit with the ray trace the player's controls will invert.
